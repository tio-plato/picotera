-- name: GetProvidersByEndpointTypesAndModel :many

-- endpoint types instead of a single endpoint path. The unified gateway
-- routes (/v1/messages, /v1/responses, /v1/chat/completions, and the two
-- Gemini variants) compute the type set from (source format, stream flag)
-- and call this. Returns the same column shape as the path-based query plus
-- e.endpoint_type so the handler can pick the right transformer per row.
