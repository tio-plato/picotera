// unifiedRoute binds a unified generation route's URL path to its source
// format, synthetic endpoint_type and display name. The unified routes are
// runtime constants mounted directly on the router (see server.go
// registerEndpoints) — they are NOT rows in the endpoint table — so this list
// is the single source of truth shared by:
//   - route registration (server.go),
//   - the unified handler (handle_unified_gateway.go), which reads Path /
//     Format / SourceType off the route rather than deriving them from the
//     format (two routes share FormatOpenAIResponses, so a format → path
//     reverse lookup no longer exists),
//   - the endpoint label list (handle_label.go), which surfaces them in the
//     requests page endpoint filter alongside the path-table endpoints.
//
// Codex is NOT in this list: its sub-paths are open-ended, so it is served by
// the wildcard mount below (codexMountPatterns — two prefixes sharing the one
// mount) with a route value computed per request by codexUnifiedRoute.
